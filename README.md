# IPL 2025 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on IPL 2025 player statistics using batting and bowling datasets.  
The goal is to analyze **player performance**, **team strength**, and **all-rounder impact** using data-driven insights and visualizations.

The analysis was performed using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** in **Google Colab**, and results are published on GitHub.

## 📂 Dataset Used
- `IPL2025Batters.csv` – Batting statistics of IPL 2025 players  
- `IPL2025Bowlers.csv` – Bowling statistics of IPL 2025 players

## ❓ Business / Analysis Questions

### 1️⃣ For players who appear in both batting and bowling datasets (all-rounders), how does their batting strike rate compare with their bowling economy rate?
This analysis identifies impactful all-rounders by comparing their attacking batting ability with bowling efficiency.

### 2️⃣ Which team has the highest combined wickets (sum of wickets of all its bowlers)?
This helps identify the strongest bowling unit in the tournament.

### 3️⃣ Which team has the highest combined runs (sum of runs of all its batters)?
This analysis highlights the most dominant batting team.

### 4️⃣ What are the economy rate and strike rate of the top 10 all-rounders?
Top-performing all-rounders are selected based on combined batting and bowling impact.

### 5️⃣ Is there a correlation between total team runs and total team wickets?
This explores whether teams that score more runs also tend to take more wickets.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab  
- GitHub

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Certain all-rounders balance high strike rates with low economy rates.
- Teams with strong batting do not always have equally strong bowling.
- A moderate correlation exists between team runs and wickets.
- All-rounders play a crucial role in overall team performance.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
